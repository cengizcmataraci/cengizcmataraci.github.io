### If you want to make a Notion based blog site

* Fork the repo
* Create an integration with Notion API
* Create a database table in Notion
* Create .env.local file with your Notion API Token and Notion Database ID
* Create some pages in Notion
* If there is no problem with the pages coming, you can start changing the entire site.
